import CliCommandCode from "@/components/markdown/cli-command-code/cli-command-code.astro"

It doesn't matter what framework or package manager you are using. Installing WDS Shadcn components is as simple as running the `shadcn add` command followed by the URL to the component you want to install. This URL will always be formatted as <code>{import.meta.env.SERVER_URL}/r/\<component-name\>.json</code>.

The entire install process is handled by the `shadcn` CLI tool and works identically to how you would install any other Shadcn component.

## Example

<CliCommandCode componentName="action-button" />
